## Functionalities

Firstly, it is important to note that you do not need an account to use our application.

There are two main features about our application. The first one consist of adding, delete and change the informations about the students.
The student requires a name and surname and the number of his class.

The second feature consist of creating, erase and update an exam.
For the exam, you will need to know where it will take place, the date, the subject and which students will take part.

## Database

We used five different tables for our database. As you could have guessed, There is the Student and the Exam but to avoid some repetition we also used tables for the Room and the subject which are linked to the Exam table itself.
The Exam and Student have a many-to-many relationship, therefor we created an intermediate, where the  table ExamsStudents to link them both.
